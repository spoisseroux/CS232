"whenever a stack function is invoked, a stack frame that contains
all the local variables of the function is created for it and then
pushed into stack memory..." This allows me to deduce that the size of the 
stack frame for this function will be the value of Stop + 1(because the 
function starts at zero) + 1 (because of the main stack); so the total
stack frame size may be the value of Stop + 2.
