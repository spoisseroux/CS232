1.What instructions evaluate “a>6”?
	cmpl $6,-4(%ebp)

2.What happens if we delete the “jmp” instruction?
	the while loop would not loop.

3.Can you rewrite the condition with “jg” in place of “jle”? Why or why not?
	No, this would change the conditions for which the if statement would execute 		because of the cmpl.
